### Scenario

Lets say you have joined a company and you are going to create a new email associating it with your department. In-order to gain access across the company and its internal services.

### Brief
You are required to utilize the constructor and help in creation of the email and it should represent `firstName.lastName@company.department.com`
It should contain fields like `mailBoxCapacity`, `alternateEmailId`, `randomPasswordGenerator`, `setDepartment`. 
It should also contain getter methods according to the scenario and plan it accordingly.
You should get an outline by know if not, you can go through the code and get an idea for yourselves.
You can enhance this even in a much better way connecting it towards a DB, providing user-input and much more.

### Takeaway
Generally its not a good practice to use constructors for user inputs instead you have to use methods which give you more flexibility inside the class.
